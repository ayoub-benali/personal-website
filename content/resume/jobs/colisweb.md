  Colisweb is a french delivery service specializing in *last mile delivery*. 
  
  I developed Scala micro-services, using a purely functional style
  and libraries such as *Cats* and *Http4s*. I've had the opportunity to migrate several services from Play Framework to Http4s and Tapir; and also
  contributed to an open source tracing library to improve the observability of their platform.

## About Colisweb

Colisweb is a french delivery service specializing in *last mile delivery*. They delivery packages weighting from a few grams up to a ton in more than 3,000 cities,
They achieve very fast delivery times of less than 2 hours by connecting merchants and transporters using advanced algorithms that provide best-in-class routing inside the city. 
These algorithms are developed by a dedicated research and development team.

## Working environment

As a team, we reviewed one another's code through merge requests, and organized *mob reviews* on a regular basis. 
Our codebase was thoroughly covered by automatic tests, with a large
proportion of them written as behavior-driven scenarios (*given, when, then*).

We containerized every micro-service and deployed them to Kubernetes.

## My contribution

- I worked on several Scala micro-services in a purely functional environment, using libraries from the Typelevel ecosystem.
- I migrated a few services from Play Framework to the Typelevel ecosystem and contributed to improve the consistency of the coding style and libraries across the project.
- I developed an open-source tracing library for Scala, and improved the observability of the Colisweb platform.
- I trained an intern and helped her develop functional programming skills.
- I deployed micro-services to Kubernetes.
