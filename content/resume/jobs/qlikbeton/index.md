## About Qlikbeton

Qlikbeton is an online marketplace that sells concrete at attractive prices during off-peak periods. They're selling in
four different countries, each with specialized business rules and different styling. 

We strived for a mostly functional codebase: side-effects were carefully separated from the purely functional business logic,
UI components had little to no intelligence and could be composed easily, we used Ramda extensively

## Working environment

My job was to develop the front end of the website within a team of 4 front-end developers.

We had to figure out ways to address all target countries while avoiding code duplication as much as possible. We came
out with a configuration system that could override not only style but complete part of the application based on the
country.

We strived for a mostly functional codebase: side-effects were carefully separated from the purely functional business logic,
UI components had little to no intelligence and could be composed easily. We made an extensive use of Ramda, a functional Javascript
library that encourages immutable objects and function composition. Following this approach led to a relatively small and easy to maintain codebase.

The project also had a 100% unit test coverage.

## What I've learned

It was my first time using [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) in a project. It made it much easier to compose and reuse 
our pure functions. 

I had the chance to work closely with another functional programming enthusiast. Exchanging our views allowed me
to be even more conformable in the practice of functional programming in the context of client-side applications.
