## About Docler Holding

Docler Holding owns several companies in media, entertainment, payment services, advertising and technology. The particular company
I was working for sold e-books and various digital goods.

## My contribution

- While my job was mostly on the front end (Angular.js 1.X at the time), I had a few opportunities to contribute to the back end (node.js and Strongloop) a few times. 
- I developed a SPA that let product owners and e-mail marketers manage every aspect of the campaigns, including visually designing e-mails using a WYSIWYG editor
- I developed a tracking system for e-mails that could measure openings, give information on the click rate of a particular campaign, and display user interaction on single e-mail as a heatmap. 

## What I've learned

It was my first experience in the e-mail marketing business. I learned about responsive e-mail integration using MJML, as well as good
practices regarding spam and deliverability of e-mails.
It was also my first experience of a full Javascript stack in production.
