Taught a 15-hour tutorial course on functional programming to students of the HEI School of Engineering in Lille.

The course covered the fundamentals of functional programming in Scala (referential transparency, totality, lazy and eager evaluation, composition, collections manipulation ...) 
and a few more advanced topics such as IO monads and functional streams (using Cats effect and fs2).

We applied these notions to the making of a project : a purely functional Tic Tac Toe game that could be played simultaneously on two computers through a TCP server.
