Hi there! Thanks for stopping on my website.

**My name is Guillaume Bogard, I am a functional programmer with an appeal for statically-typed languages
and distributed systems.**

I code mostly in Scala by day, and Haskell by night. 
My hobbies include writing on my [blog](/posts), [making videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJ2z2ywUUbJaG1uGciI2hg), going to the movies,
riding roller-coasters and making noise on mechanical keyboards that go _click! clack!_.

I work for [Canal+](https://www.canalplus.com/), the french leader of pay-television and a global
leader of film production. We are handling 900K video assets and modernizing the internal video management tools 
using 100+ Scala micro-services. 
Here's my [résumé](/jobs) should you need more details.
