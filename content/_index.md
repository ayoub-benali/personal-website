Hi there! Thanks for stopping on my website.

My name is Guillaume Bogard, I am a functional programmer with an appeal for strongly-typed languages
and distributed systems. I write moslty in Scala, ReasonML, sometimes Javascript. I love to learn and
share my knowledge with other people.
My hobbies include writing on my [blog](/posts), going the movies,
riding roller-coasters and making noise on mechanical keyboards that go *click! clack!*.

I am currently working for [Linkvalue](https://link-value.fr), a french consulting company. Here's my 
[résumé](/jobs) should you need more details.
