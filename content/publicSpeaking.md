### Functional programming training

I enjoy sharing my knowledge and producing educational content. I am an experienced 
programming instructor and have taught functional programming in Scala 
to dozens of professional developers and computer science students alike.

I am currently building [Lambda Town](https://lambda.town/), the first
e-learning platform dedicated to teaching functional programming, Scala, Cats and Apache Spark, using
high-quality videos and real-world-focused interactive exercises.

If you are interested in in-person training on Scala and FP for you or your team, [get in touch](#get-in-touch).

### Public Speaking

I've had several opportunities to talk publicly about my favorite topics : Scala, React, and
functional programming.

I also gave functional programming introduction classes to students in engineering. Here are some of my talks:

- Meetup : IO Monad & Error management, from Exceptions to Cats MTL (2019)
  - [Slides on Github](https://github.com/gbogard/cats-mtl-talk)
  - [Typelevel Summit NYC 2020 Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WXgEGbf0iQ&t=387s)
