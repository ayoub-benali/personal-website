### Public Speaking

I've had several opportunities to talk publicly about my favorite topics : Scala, React, and
functional programming.

- [2-day Workshop : Functional programming in Scala (2019) (Exercises and slides on Github)](https://github.com/gbogard/scala-training)
- [Meetup : Managing side effects in React applications (2019)](/posts/discover-redux-saga/)
- [Introduction to Akka actors for beginners at Scala.io (2018) (Talk in French)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcj8IaG9_wc)
