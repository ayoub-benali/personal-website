Colisweb is a french delivery solution present in over 3,000 cities. Their goal is deliver all sorts of packages, from
less than a 1kg to a ton, either in less than 2 hours or on appointment. They achieve very fast delivery times by
connecting merchants and transporters using advanced algorithms that provide best-in-class routing inside the city. Those
are developed by a dedicated research and development team.

As a Scala developer, my job is mostly to integrate these algorithms into the ecosystem by building APIs, leveraging the
Typelevel ecosystem for truly functional, type-safe programs. I played a big role in the migration of some of their services to a more functional architecture, and had the opportunity to work on an open-source project : [Scala Opentracing](https://github.com/Colisweb/scala-opentracing).
