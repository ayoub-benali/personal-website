## Open source contributions

- While working for Colisweb, I've built [Scala Opentracing](https://github.com/Colisweb/scala-opentracing), a functional tracing library for Cats Effect,
Http4s, and Tapir.
- I am currently a contributor to [Flora](https://github.com/flora-pm/flora-server), an alternative package index for the Haskell ecosystem with mirroring capabilities.
- I have several publicly available thingies, mostly examples and slides for my talks, available 
on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/gbogard).
