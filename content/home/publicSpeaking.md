### Public Speaking

I've had several opportunities to talk publicly about my favorite topics : Functional programming and distributed systems.

I also gave functional programming introduction classes to students in engineering. Here are some of my talks:

### Functional programming training
I enjoy sharing my knowledge and producing educational content. I am an experienced 
programming instructor and have taught functional programming in Scala 
to dozens of professional developers and computer science students.

I can deliver training sessions, in English and French, covering, but not limited to
- programming with pure functions
- building HTTP applications using pure functional programming in Scala
- functional programming foundations in Haskell

If you are interested in in-person training on Scala and FP for you or your team, [get in touch](#get-in-touch).
