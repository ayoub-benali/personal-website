Fs2 is a Scala library for stream processing. This video is an introductory tutorial on fs2, which covers building streams, inifinte streams, effects, and files IO.

We use fs2 to read a very big CSV file (more than 3 GB), parse it, and transform every row to a JSON object, by taking advantage of the file reading and writing abilities of the library. No previous knowledge of fs2 is needed.
